# RecyclerView-CardView
RecyclerView + CardView

Tips.
For those struggling with the syncing of the dependencies:
If you are using the new androidx libraries instead of regular android, you need to use the dependencies I have outlined below (in the build gradle app) instead of the ones shown in this video:

    implementation 'androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview-selection:1.0.0'
    implementation 'androidx.cardview:cardview:1.0.0'

Now when you press sync, it should work. Hope this helps
